                        <p>Banff National Park is Canada's <strong>oldest national park</strong>, established in 1885.
                            Located in
                            Alberta's Rocky Mountains, 110–180 kilometres west of Calgary, Banff
                            encompasses
                            6,641 square kilometres of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice
                            fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes. <strong>The Icefields
                                Parkway</strong> extends from
                            Lake Louise, connecting to <strong>Jasper National Park</strong> in the north. Provincial
                            forests and Yoho
                            National Park are neighbours to the west, while <strong>Kootenay National Park</strong> is
                            located to the
                            south and Kananaskis Country to the southeast. The main commercial centre of the park is the
                            town of Banff, in the Bow River valley.


                            As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of
                            its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a
                            two-year study which resulted in management recommendations and new policies that aim to
                            preserve ecological integrity.

                        <h3>Climate</h3>Banff National Park has a subarctic climate with three ecoregions, including
                        montane,
                        subalpine, and alpine. The forests are dominated by Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and
                        Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice.
                        Mammal species such as the grizzly bear, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are
                        found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but only
                        a limited number of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary
                        rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55 million years ago.
                        Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today
                        are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest
                        uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the
                        mountains into their current shapes.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h3>Conservation</h3>In 1984, Banff was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Canadian Rocky
                        Mountain Parks World
                        Heritage Site, together with the other national and provincial parks that form the Canadian
                        Rocky Mountain Parks, for the mountain landscapes containing mountain peaks, glaciers,
                        lakes, waterfalls, canyons and limestone caves as well as fossil beds. With this designation
                        came added obligations for conservation. During the 1980s, Parks Canada moved to privatize
                        many park services such as golf courses, and added user fees for use of other facilities and
                        services to help deal with budget cuts. In 1990, the town of Banff was incorporated, giving
                        local residents more say regarding any proposed developments. In the 1990s, development
                        plans for the park, including expansion at Sunshine Village, were under fire with lawsuits
                        filed by Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). In the mid-1990s, the Banff-Bow
                        Valley Study was initiated to find ways to better address environmental concerns, and issues
                        relating to development in the park.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h3>Lake Louise</h3>Lake Louise, a hamlet located 54 km northwest of the town of Banff, is home
                        to the landmark
                        Chateau Lake Louise at the edge of Lake Louise. Located 15 km from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake
                        provides a scenic vista of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. This scene was pictured on the back
                        of the $20 Canadian banknote, in the 1969–1979 ("Scenes of Canada") series. The Lake Louise
                        Mountain Resort is also located near the village. Lake Louise is one of the most visited
                        lakes in the world and is framed to the southwest by the Mount Victoria Glacier.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h3>Canmore</h3>
                        With the cap on growth in the town of Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary,
                        has been growing rapidly to serve increasing demands of tourists. Major development proposals
                        for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which has been the
                        subject of contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the development would
                        fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.
